# Handwritten_digit_recogniser

Overview

This project involves building a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 labeled images of digits (0-9). Each image is a 28x28 grayscale pixel matrix. The goal is to develop an effective classifier that can accurately predict the digit in each image.

The model uses various techniques, including data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model training with algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), or Random Forest. Data augmentation techniques like rotation and zoom are applied to improve the modelâ€™s performance.

The final model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, achieving a robust digit recognition system suitable for practical applications such as automated form processing or digit-based data entry systems.
